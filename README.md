# Nook Library

NookLibrary is the backbone of the Nook 2D game engine. It provides all the essential systems for 2D game development, including rendering, physics, input handling, and more. Built on a modular Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, this library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your own game projects.

## What Does It Do?
  - Rendering: Powered by SFML, for smooth 2D graphics and windowing.
  - Physics: Uses Box2D for realistic simulations.
  - Input Handling: Keyboard, mouse, and controller input made easy.
  - UI: Debug menus and interfaces with ImGui-SFML.
  - Modular Design: Built with the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture for flexibility.

## How to Use It
### Use [NookCLI](https://github.com/ferstormblessed/nookcli) to Set Up Your Project

The NookCLI tool streamlines the process of setting up a new project with NookLibrary fully integrated, eliminating the need for manual configuration. When you use NookCLI, it generates a new project that includes a pre-configured CMake setup, ensuring that NookLibrary is properly linked and ready to use
